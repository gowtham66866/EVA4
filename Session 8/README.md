1. [Objective](#objective)  
2. [Model Summary](#model-summary)
3. [Result Summary](#result-summary)
4. [Result Visualizations](#result-visualizations) (misclassification/accuracy/loss)

## Objective   
1. Code uses GPU - **Done**  
2. Use the architecture to RESNET18 - **Done**  
3. Achieve 85% accuracy, with no limit on no of parameters - **Done**   
4. All the code is split and individual modules are called upon for execution - **Done**
